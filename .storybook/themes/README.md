# Example Themes

These JSON files are **not official themes**. They are example overrides that demonstrate what is possible using Cast UI's `createTheme()` customisation system.

They are used only in Storybook (local dev and Chromatic visual testing) and are **never published** in the npm package.

To create your own theme, see the [Creating a Custom Theme](../../README.md) section in the main README.
